pub(super) static PROJECTS: &str = r#"# Projects
   The easiest way to see what I've been up to lately is to check out my GitHub profile: *https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17*

## Software Sideprojects
* **Managarr**: A Rust-based TUI for managing many different Servarr instances (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/managarr*).
* **ClaSH**: This shell and website (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/ClaSH*)
* **Alerting-API**: A simple API that utilizes the Quartz library to provide a dynamic, reactive alerting system (minus the notification component), built with Kotlin. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/alerting-api*)
* **AWS Cloud Gaming**: A Bash TUI built with whiptail to provision an EC2 instance in AWS, configure it with Steam, set up a low-latency RDP session using AWS' own NICE DCV to play games using AWS EC2 instances. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/aws-cloud-gaming*)
* **DynamoDB and DAX Benchmarker**: A simple benchmarking utility built in both Rust and Go to benchmark performance differences between a DynamoDB table that doesn't use DAX, and one that does. An Elastic stack is used to receive the benchmarking metrics in real time so that users can also visualize the benchmarking results in Kibana using the pre-built dashboard. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/dynamodb-dax-benchmarker*)
* **cp_sat**: Rust FFI bindings for the Google OR-Tools CP-SAT Solver to allow using the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver in Rust. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/cp_sat*)

## Mathematics Sideprojects
* **Real Analysis - Theorems and Definitions**: A large LaTeX book that's designed to be a quick-reference for many theorems, definitions, lemmas, corrollaries, etc. that are useful when proving conjectures or when studying properties of real numbers. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/real-analysis-theorems-and-definitions*)
* **Abstract Algebra - Theorems and Definitions**: Like the previous project, this one is the same idea, except it's a collection of theorems, definitions, etc. in Abstract Algebra for quick-reference. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/abstract-algebra-theorems-and-definitions*)
* **Linear Algebra - Theorems and Definitions**: Like the previous two projects, this one is the same idea, except it's a collection of theorems, definitions, etc. in Linear Algebra for quick-reference. It's proven to be incredibly useful when designing models, or when optimizing database queries. (*https://github.com/Dark-Alex-17/linear-algebra-theorems-and-definitions*)

## Piano
* In my free time, I also love to play the piano. I've posted some videso of myself playing on my TikTok for anyone curious! (*https://www.tiktok.com/@alextusa0*)
